This is a fairly complete port of the extremely popular WordPress 
Kubrick template (version 1.2.6) to bBlog.

You can find the original template and information at:
http://binarybonsai.com/kubrick/

This template XHTML, CSS and images are all released under the GPL.

To use, unzip the contents of this zip file into your bblog/templates directory 
(or unzip locally, and upload).

Now go to the bBlog admin console, click on Options, and select the Kubrick
template from the dropdown menu, and click Save Options.

This template has been tested with bBlog 0.7.4 and bBlog CVS, but I make no 
guarantees as to compatibility.

Please contact rcgabriel@yahoo.com with bug reports, feedback or to heap
praise on me for my efforts.

Release 1 - Initial Release (10/28/04)
Release 2 - Fixed image locations to simplify installation (11/03/04)
